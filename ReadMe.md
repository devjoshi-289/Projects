# Movie Rating Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes IMDB movie data to gain insights into trends such as movie ratings, revenue, director performance, and genre distribution. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore data trends and present them visually.

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on the **IMDB-Movie-Data.csv** file, which contains details about movies, including:
- **Title**
- **Year**
- **Runtime (Minutes)**
- **Genre**
- **Director**
- **Revenue (Millions)**
- **Rating**
- **Votes**

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Handles missing values
  - Removes duplicates
  - Formats data for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Correlation heatmap for missing values
  - Summary statistics of key attributes
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Top 10 highest-rated movies**
  - **Top 10 highest-revenue movies**
  - **Votes and revenue distribution by year**
  - **Number of movies released per year**
  - **Scatter plot of ratings vs. revenue**
- **Movie Genre Count:**
  - Accepts user input to count occurrences of a specific genre

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **NumPy**

## 📜 How to Run
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Script
Execute the script with:
